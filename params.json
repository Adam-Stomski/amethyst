The goals of Amethyst are to be fast as Node.js and comfortable as Rails. Note, Amethyst is at early stage of developing, so a lot of features are missing yet. However, it works :). Why I called my web framework \"Amethyst\"? Because Crystal  has a light purple color at GitHub like [amethyst gemstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst).\r\n\r\nLatest version - [0.0.7](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/releases/tag/v0.0.7)\r\n\r\nFor detailed information, see docs on our [wiki](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki) below:\r\n\r\n* [Installation](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki/Installation)\r\n* [Usage](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki/Usage)\r\n* [Controllers](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki/Controllers)\r\n* [Routing](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki/Routing)\r\n* [Middleware](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki/Middleware)\r\n* [Static files](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki/StaticFiles)\r\n* [Applications](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst/wiki/Applications)\r\n\r\n[Here are some benchmarking results](https://gist.github.com/Codcore/0c7a331b69eed542fb78)\r\n\r\nFor now, next things are implemented:\r\n* class-based controllers with method-based actions\r\n* middleware support\r\n* simple REST routing\r\n* path, GET and POST params inside actions\r\n* base cookies support\r\n* static files serving\r\n* http logger and timer for developers\r\n* simple environments support\r\n## Example\r\nHere is classic 'Hello World' in Amethyst\r\n```crystal\r\nrequire \"amethyst\"\r\n\r\nclass WordController < Base::Controller\r\n  actions :hello\r\n\r\n  def hello\r\n    html \"<h1>Hello, world!\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass HelloWorldApp < Base::App\r\n  routes.draw do\r\n    all \"/\",      \"word#hello\" \r\n    get \"/hello\", \"word#hello\" \r\n    register WordController\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\napp = HelloWorldApp.new\r\napp.serve\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nI would be glad for any help with contributing.\r\n\r\n1.
